# RenataOGomes

I'm an international stuent from Brazil, currently a freshman at Indiana University Bloomington, with a major in Journalism and a minor in Graphic Design. I'm currently working as a Page Designer for the Indiana Daily Student, in Bloomington,IN. Previously, I've done some work as a Page Designer for the Press Agency in several Model UN Conferences. You can see samples of my work in this website in Portuguese and in English.
When I'm not at work, I enjoy travelling, riding the bus (I think that is the best way to get to know a new town) and drinking lots of coffee. No, seriously, I am ALWAYS with a cup of coffee in my hand. Also, I love to learn new things. Now, I'm working on my French skills and learning some programming. I am passionate about literature and photography, and teaching others the things I love.
